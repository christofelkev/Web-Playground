        <p><b>The cockatiel</b>
            (/ˌkɒkəˈtiːl/;[2] Nymphicus hollandicus), also known as the weero/weiro[3][4] or quarrion,[5][6] is a
            medium-sized[7] parrot that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They
            are
            prized as household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed
            compared to
            other parrots. As a caged bird, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatiel">cockatiels</a> are second
            in
            popularity only to the budgerigar.[8]

            <h2>Taxonomy and etymology</h2>
            <p>
                The cockatiel is the only member of the genus Nymphicus. It was previously unclear whether the cockatiel
                is
                a
                crested parakeet or small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own
                subfamily, Nymphicinae. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest subfamily of the Cacatuidae
                (cockatoo
                family). Cockatiels are native to Australia, favouring the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and
                bushlands.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Sexual dimorphism</h3>
        <h4>Colour mutations</h4>
        <p>The cockatiel's distinctive crest expresses the animal's emotional state. The crest is dramatically vertical
            when
            the cockatiel is startled or excited, gently oblique in its neutral or relaxed state, and flattened close to
            the
            head when the animal is angry or defensive. The crest is also held flat but protrudes outward in the back
            when
            the cockatiel is trying to appear alluring or flirtatious. When the cockatiel is tired, the crest is seen
            positioned halfway upwards, with the tip of the crest usually curling upward.<sup><a
                    href="cockatiel.com">[14]</a></sup> In contrast
            to most cockatoos,
            the cockatiel has long tail feathers roughly making up half of its total length. At 30 fto 33 cm (12 to 13
            in),
            the cockatiel is the smallest of the cockatoos, which are generally larger at between 30 and 60 cm (12 and
            24
            in).</p>
