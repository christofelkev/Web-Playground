    <h1>Anime</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: <a href="#anime">[aꜜɲime]</a> ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation
        originating from Japan.
        Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and
        in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated
        works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are
        also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and artstyles that can be considered as
        "anime".

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes
        mistakenly classified as a genre itself.[7] In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin.[8] English-language dictionaries typically define anime (/ˈænɪmeɪ/)[9] as "a
        style of Japanese animation"[10] or as "a style of animation originating in Japan".[11] Other definitions are
        based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".[12]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Precursors</h3>
    <p>Emakimono and shadow plays (kage-e) are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[18] Emakimono was common in
        the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled
        from the right to left in chronological order, as a moving panorama.[18] Kage-e was popular during the Edo
        period and originated from the shadow plays of China.[18] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular
        in the eighteenth century.[18] The paper play called kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained
        popular in the street theater until the 1930s.[18] Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are
        considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animation.[18] Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for
        anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.[18]</p>


    <h3>Pioneers</h3>
    <p>Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques
        pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[19] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is
        Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907),[20] a private work by an unknown creator.[21] In 1917, the first professional and
        publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi
        Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's
        Namakura Gatana.[22] Many early works were </p>
